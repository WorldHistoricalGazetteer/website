<h4>Privacy</h4>

<p>
    You may use WHG freely without registering. If you choose to register, we require a name and a valid email address,
    which we will never share without your explicit permission. We may <strong><em>occasionally</em></strong> notify
    registered users of changes to the system or impending downtime that could affect their use of it.

<h5 class="mt-3">Use of Turnstile</h5>
<p>
    To protect against automated abuse (bots), WHG uses
    <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Turnstile</a>.
    When Turnstile is displayed (for example, on forms submitted by unregistered users), your browser may communicate
    with Cloudflare’s servers to verify that you are a human visitor. This may involve the transmission of limited
    technical information (such as IP address and browser characteristics). Cloudflare does not use this information for
    advertising or cross-site tracking; it is used solely to ensure the security and integrity of WHG services.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">ORCID Registration and Sign-In</h5>
<p>
    If you choose to register or sign in using your ORCID iD, WHG will — with your permission — access your public
    ORCID record (name, iD, and affiliation) and any information visible to “Trusted parties”, including at least one
    verified email address. This information is stored securely in your WHG profile and used only for account management
    and necessary communication. After your account is created, we will ask separately for your consent to receive
    optional newsletters. You may revoke WHG’s access at any time through your ORCID account settings.
