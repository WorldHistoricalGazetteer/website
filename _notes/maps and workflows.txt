map pages and workflows 10 June 2024
====================================

- upload a dataset
	- most are small(ish); some not
	- in ds_browse, view and monitor progress of reconciliation review
		- new map markers, links, variants; filters on table
	- preview at any time in ds_places pub page
	- implications for cached pages, tilesets if large

- publish a dataset
	- WHG editor flips 'public' switch
	- all place records indexed to 'pub' index; now discoverable in search
	- ds_places pub page now visible
	- appears in dataset gallery
	- can be 'featured' for home page carousel
	- now static

- create a place collection
	- virtually all are small (who would annotate over 500 place records?)
	- but possible to add all places from an eligible dataset
	- preview at any time in place_collection_browse pub page
	- on submit to class/workshop, group leader views pub page
	- (rarely) made public by WHG editor, on request
	- (rarely) nominated and accepted for student gallery on teaching page
	- contents grow continually during authorship, and potentially afterwards
	- can be 'featured' for home page carousel

- create a dataset collection
	- no stated limit to number or size of member datasets
		- some envisioned to be several 10s of 1000s <= feasible?
	- during assembly, constantly changing, even after publication ('editions'?)
	- made public by WHG editor, on request => appears in gallery
	- implications for cached pages, tilesets if large
	- can be 'featured' for home page carousel
