    <h4>Making a WHG collection public</h4>
    <p>By definition, a new collection can only contain datasets already designated "public." However, new collections are initially "private"&mdash;that is, visible only to you (the "owner") and to the WHG team. Before a collection goes public, the WHG editorial team will do a quick review to ensure the metadata is sufficient, and that the public screens displaying its contents are performing properly.
    <p class="larger">If you are ready to make your collection public, please let us know with this <a data-whg-modal="/contact_modal/">contact form</a>.
