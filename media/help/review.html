      <p>This is a complicated screen. The information displayed and options offered are explained below.</p>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>The user-designated label of the current dataset</li>
          <li>Save / defer: After making match decisions (closeMatch or no match), click the Save button, If you want to defer a decision on this record, click 'defer' and it will go in a 'deferred' queue where it can be revisited.</li>
          <li>The current "PASS." If any automatic matches were made based on shared links, a PASS 0 is included, and these can be accepted <i>en masse</i> from the Linking screen. Otherwise, you  will be stepped through potential matches from PASS 1 and then PASS 2, and in the case of Getty TGN, possibly PASS 3.</li>
          <li>It is possible to undo the las Save action; sometimes we click, then think better of it.</li>
          <li>The record from your dataset, as sent for matching. If it had associate geometry it will appear as green markers.</li>
          <li>Close match vs. no match. This is explained in depth in its own section below</li>
          <li>The globe icon indicates the potential match includes geometry. Hovering the mouse over the link will highlight it on the map.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>What does closeMatch mean?</h5>
        <p>The meaning of <i>closeMatch</i> derives from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/" target="_blank">Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary</a>, a widely used data model. Practically speaking, for WHG asserting a "clseMatch" serves as a linking "glue." Specifically, records that share one or more common linked asserted as (<i>closeMatch</i>) are joined/linked in our "union index" and returned together in response to queries. For example, records for Abyssinia and Ethiopia share two <i>closeMatch</i> links, to a DBPedia record and a TGN record. Therefore, they appear together when searching for either Abyssinia or Ethiopia. We have determined there is not a clear enough distinction with SKOS:exactMatch to offer that choice.</p>
        <p>From the SKOS specification:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>closeMatch</i>: "...(the) two concepts are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably
            in some information retrieval applications"</li>
          <li><i>exactMatch</i>: "...a high degree of confidence that two concepts can be used interchangeably
            across a wide range of information retrieval applications."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, <i>closeMatch</i> is a super-property of <i>exactMatch</i>; that is, every <i>exactMatch</i>
          is also a <i>closeMatch</i>. Remember, the purpose of the assertion is to ensure records that should
          intuitively appear together, do.</p>
