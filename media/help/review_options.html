    <h4>Reconciliation Review Options</h4>
    <p>When reviewing results of a reconciliation task, saving a match will by default create new "PlaceGeom"
      and "PlaceLink" records in the WHG databse from the matched records, now associated with your Place.
      You can decline accepting geometry by un-checking that box here. You can also choose to accept name variants
      from matched WIkidata records (generating new "PlaceName" records) by checking that box. There are
      often a great many name and language variants in a Wikidata place record,
    </p>
    <p>Note that these new records do not alter your original data, they simply augment it within the WHG system.
      And downloads of the augmented data will include those newly acquired values.</p>
