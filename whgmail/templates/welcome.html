    <p>Thank you for registering for the World Historical Gazetteer (WHG). You can look at our 
        <a href="https://whgazetteer.org/documentation/">Documentation</a> 
        to learn more about the services and features the platform provides.
    </p>

    <p>WHG is gathering contributions of place dataâ€”large and small, and for all regions and historical periods. 
        WHG provides services for geocoding place names, linking records for "closely matched" places, 
        and on request, publishing contributed datasets and user-created collections. 
        WHG is an excellent resource for teachers and students. Teachers can use its place information 
        to develop lessons and to make custom maps for presentation in lectures.
    </p>

    <p>The "Place Collection" feature enables building and publishing sets of user-annotated place records, 
        accompanied by an explanatory essay, image, and links to external resources. 
        The WHG "union index" of place attestations drawn from multiple contributed datasets will over time 
        increasingly link the disparate research of contributors on the dimension of place. 
        Furthermore, by bringing together all the known references for a place without privileging 
        any particular one, it decenters colonial name-making.
    </p>

    <p>WHG is currently accepting dataset and place collection contributions, which can be published on the site. 
        If you would like to set up a consultation to discuss these in more detail, please drop us a line using the 
        Contact Form on the <a href="https://whgazetteer.org/">website</a>.
