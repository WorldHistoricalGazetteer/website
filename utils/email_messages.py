    'Thank you for registering for the World Historical Gazetteer (WHG). You can visit '
    '<a href="https://whgazetteer.org/tutorials/guide/">the WHG site guide</a> '
    'to learn more about services and features the platform provides.\n\n'
    'WHG is gathering contributions of place dataâ€”large and small, and for all regions and historical periods.'
    'WHG provides services for geocoding place names, linking records for "closely matched" places, '
    'and on request, publishing contributed datasets and user-created collections. '
    'WHG is an excellent resource for teachers and students. Teachers can use its place information '
    'to develop lessons and to make custom maps for presentation in lectures. \n\n'
    'The "Place Collection" feature enables building and publishing sets of user-annotated place records, '
    'accompanied by an explanatory essay, image, and links to external resources. '
    'The WHG "union index" of place attestations drawn from multiple contributed datasets will over time '
    'increasingly link the disparate research of contributors on the dimension of place. '
    'Furthermore, by bringing together all the known references for a place without privileging '
    'any particular one, it decenters colonial name making.\n\n'
    'We are accepting dataset and place collection contributions, which can be published on the site. '
    'If you would like to set up a consultation to discuss these in more detail, just reply to this message\n\n'
